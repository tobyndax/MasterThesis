\section{Spherical Decomposition}\label{sec:decomp}
\cite{gpugems} presents a method for collision detection and response using spherical
decomposition. By subdividing the geometry into a collection of spheres one gets an
approximation of the shape. Since each new geometry is locally convex, collision
detection is much simplified, but the global result of the decomposition still have
concave properties. Since each new geometry is the same primitive only
one type of collision detection and response is needed, spheres in this case.
For an example of geometries
decomposed in this manner see figure~\ref{fig:bunnies}.

\subsection{Spring-damper model}
Spring-damper model is the model for collision response described in~\cite{gpugems} and by~\cite{fossum}.
The model has the benefit of being quite easy to implement on both CPU and GPU.
However, since there are two design parameters, the spring coefficient and the damping
constant, the system can be hard to tune. Often a parameter constellation that works
fine for one system will fail for another.

The equations below describe how the force and torque can be derived for this type
of model. The equations describe the forces for collision between sphere i and j,
where k is the spring constant, c the damping constant and d the
diameter of the sphere. In equation~\ref{eq:tangent}, $\hat{r}$ refers to the
position of the particle relative to the body's center.

\begin{equation}
  \vec{f}_{i,spring} = -k(d-|\vec{r}_{ij}|)\frac{\vec{r}_{ij}}{|\vec{r}_{ij}|}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \vec{f}_{i,damping} = -c\vec{v}_{ij}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \vec{v}_{ij} = \vec{v}_{particle} + \vec{v}_{tangential}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:tangent}
  \vec{v}_{tangential} = \vec{\omega} \cross ( \vec{r}- \vec{\omega}\bullet\frac{\vec{\omega}}{|\vec{\omega}^2|})
\end{equation}

Note that the equations above are mass independent which might be one of the
reasons for it's common use with the particle method.

This method has two unknown parameters, c and k, which must be tuned for the
specific system for stability. Often these parameters are decided through testing
and the tests need to be redone for new setups.

\section{Multiple contacts in sequential solvers}
When solving with multiple contacts between a body pair one can rewind time to
find the first collision
that occurred in the system (a single body pair, or globally), process it first
then step forward until the next collision and so forth. However this method can
be quite time consuming and lack parallelism since we get an ordering in the solver.
If we do not back the system in time and
instead simply solve all collisions we have currently and take some special care
towards interpenetration we would end up with an incorrect simulation. The problem
becomes apparent through the following example.
In figure~\ref{fig:ballsExpected} we see the expected result and in
figure~\ref{fig:noSplit} we see the result if one uses a naive implementation of
parallel impulses.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width = 0.8\textwidth]{ballsExpected.png}
  \caption{The expected result of the collision between the rigid body consisting
  of the red balls and the rigid body consisting of the green balls.}
  \label{fig:ballsExpected}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width = 0.8\textwidth]{ballsNoMassSplit.png}
  \caption{Calculating all impulses in parallel can lead to too high end velocities.}
  \label{fig:noSplit}
\end{figure}

This problem can be remedied by only solving one impulse between a body pair at a time.
This can be achieved as above stated by either backing up time until there
is only one collision, or a few collisions and then solve one of them, chosen
arbitrarily. This gives rise to a order dependent system, and is something which
makes for difficult realizations in parallel algorithms. Another approach popularized
by Erin Catto in his Box2D is 'Sequential Impulses' which solves the worst interpenetration
on each respective body pair, updates the velocities and iterates for a few iterations.
One interesting aspect here is that negative impulses are allowed in intermediate
results. However as the name suggests it is most suitable for a sequential implementation.
Both of the methods above suggests that only one collision between a body pair should
be solved at a time which leads to sequential processing. For more details see \cite{catto}.
This method could arguably be parallelized in the sense that each body could be
processed in parallel, however a different approach is used for this thesis.

\section{Mass splitting}\label{sec:massSplit}
\cite{tonge} describes, in their paper, a parallel constraint based solver
using mass splitting. A similar approach where we split the mass prior to
calculating the impulses by the number of collision between the two bodies. The
calculated impulses are then applied to the original object.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width = 0.8\textwidth]{ballsMassSplit.png}
  \caption{By mass splitting the objects by the number of interbody collisions
  and applying the resulting impulses to the non-split object we get the expected result.}
  \label{fig:massSplit}
\end{figure}

For this method to be implementable we need to count the number of collisions between
every body pair. This is described in further detail in section~\ref{sec:colMatrix}.

With $\vec{j}$ defined as in equation~\ref{eq:finalJ} divide $\vec{j}$ by
the number of collisions between the collision pair, here defined as $k$. The final modification to
$\vec{j}$ before applying it to the bodies then becomes the following.

\begin{equation}
  \vec{j}_{mass split} = \frac{\vec{j}}{k}
\end{equation}

\section{Collision Detection}\label{sec:gridCD}
\subsection{Spatial partitioning}
~\cite{gpugems} suggests spatial partitioning
by ways of a uniform grid for collision detection. This method is especially suitable
for the spherical decomposition since for fixed sphere radius we can select an optimized
grid size. In addition~\cite{gpugems},~\cite{green} and~\cite{fastnearest} claim that sorting
the collisions by bin number increases memory coherence and overall performance.
\subsection{Parallel Sweep-And-Prune}
Parallel Sweep-And-Prune as investigated by~\cite{gpupipedev}, which in turn cites~\cite{liu2010}, %Find this source
discuss a single axis Sweep-And-Prune algorithm on the GPU for broadphase collision
detection using bounding boxes and the Separating-Axis-Theorem. For more details
concerning the basics of Sweep-And-Prune, turn to the work of~\cite{SAPPierre}.

\section{Time-stepping schemes}
\cite{Lembcke} describes using Guendelman's time stepping
algorithm. By, for example, detecting when the velocity is very small one can
calculate the contact impulse by setting $\epsilon = 0$.
Guendelman's time stepping algorithm is provided in pseudocode below, in accordance
to what is described in~\cite{guendelman}.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
  \State DetectCollisions
  \ForAll{collisions with v > 0}
    \State calculateImpulses
  \EndFor
  \State applyGravity
  \State updateVelocity
    \ForAll{collisions with |v| <= $\epsilon_v$}
      \State calculateImpulse (with elasticity = 0)
    \EndFor
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\section{Nonconvex collision with stacking}
\cite{guendelman} present in their paper \textit{"Nonconvex Rigid Bodies with Stacking"}
a scenario very similar to what this thesis aim to produce.
While the end results are impressive in terms of simulating the scenario the performance
is not particularly good. Dropping 500 rings consisting of 320 triangles averaged 3 minutes per frame.
\subsection{Shock Propagation}
In the same paper~\cite{guendelman} presents the Shock Propagation algorithm.
By constructing a contact graph from the static objects in the scene, see figure~\ref{fig:cont},
then solving the objects in contact with the static objects first, then change their
mass making them static and solve the next layer and so forth. This lead to much
higher stability in simulations, but does however introduce a sequential dependency
since each level of the graph need to be processed before the next.

\section{Hierarchical Approximate Convex Decomposition}
A popular method for collision detection concerning complex concave objects
are convex decomposition. Reasons for the methods' popularity may be it's relative
simplicity in theory. Dividing the concave model down into subsets, which are
all convex can give composite shapes that are concave yet still work with the
traditional collision detection and response models since they work on convex
sub-shapes, see figure~\ref{fig:hacdSimple}, where an initially concave shape has
been subdivided in smaller convex shapes. Creating composite shapes in a physics
engine is fairly straightforward as each submodel contributes to the inertia and
mass of the object. Each objects previous collision shape can be used or a new collision
shape for the whole object can be recalculated. Each submodel's forces from collisions
contribute to the whole objects' movement instead of it's own.
There are some automatic methods for convex decompositions, among them HACD developed by~\cite{mamou}.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width = 0.8\textwidth]{hacdSimple.png}
  \caption{The basic idea behind HACD, subdividing a concave shape into smaller convex ones.}
  \label{fig:hacdSimple}
\end{figure}

\cite{HACD} investigated the use of HACD and found it to produce fewer hulls
than previous methods while still approximating the original objects well.
Mamou is currently working on a newer version of HACD called
V-HACD, which among other things include GPU acceleration, this library will not be
tested as it has not been integrated into Bullet 2.83 as of yet.
