For synthetic data generation with concave collision objects, two physics simulations techniques are investigated;convex decomposition ofmesh models for globally concave collision results, used with the physics simulationlibrary Bullet, and a GPU implemented rigid body solver using spherical decompositionand impulse based physics with a spatial sorting-based collision detection.Using the GPU solution for rigid body physics suggested in the thesis scenes containing large amounts of bodies results in a rigid body simulation up to 2 times faster than Bullet 2.83.
