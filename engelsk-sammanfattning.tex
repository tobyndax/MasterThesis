For synthetic data generation with concave collision objects two physics simulations techniques are investigated.Convex decomposition ofmesh models for globally concave collision results, used with the physics simulationlibrary Bullet. A GPU implemented rigid body solver using spherical decompositionand impulse based physics with a spatial sorting-based collision detection.Using the GPU solution for rigid body physics suggested in the thesis scenes containing large amounts of bodies, up to a factor 2 in terms of performance can be gained in comparison to Bullet.
