\chapter{Evaluation of results}\label{cha:eval}
Physics simulations are inherintely hard to evaluate and most evaluations have to
resolve to evaluating expected results for particularly difficult scenarios.
For this thesis work I suggest that the evaluation is performed as a comparison
towards a baseline solution where a single box is used as the collision primitive
for the model. Shortcomings of this model should be apparent and comparisons of
what the implemented model can handle in relation to the simple method gives a
reasonable method for evaluating the results. In addition the methods will be
evaluated in terms of performance and concave collision properties.
